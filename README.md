# FilterIt
 Here is a filtering site for all your images (this is only a test so don't really take it as a full app) all you have to do is paste any image URL and then click on any of the buttons on the side and adjust using the slider. And then voila a perfect image, you won't ever have to pay a subscription again...(well maybe)
